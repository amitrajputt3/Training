# OSI MODEL
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection, where open stands to say non proprietary. It is a 7-layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. The OSI reference model was developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization‘, in the year 1984.
The OSI model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding network communication. However it is usually not directly implemented in its entirety in real-world networking hardware or software. Instead, specific protocols and technologies are often designed based on the principles outlined in the OSI model to facilitate efficient data transmission and networking operations.

- Prestation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
